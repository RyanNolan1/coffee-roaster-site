## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I really enjoyed making this site and learnt a ton in the process, such as how to use media queries more effectively, building websites mobile first and learning to take my time thinking about a problem instead of just jumping into coding straight away.

### Useful resources

- [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) - This helped me massively in making the entire site responsive.

- [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) - Another great resource for learning responsive website design.
